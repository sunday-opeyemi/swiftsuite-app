Lee machines their mold blocks from aluminum making them rust resistant. Aluminum molds heat up and cool down faster than iron or steel molds and good bullets can usually be produced only after a few casts. In addition, aluminum blocks are one-third the weight of iron or steel mold blocks offering the bullet caster less fatigue during extended casting sessions. To ensure the best possible bullets, mold block halves are CNC machined for unmatched roundness and size control. Weights given are Lee weights with suggested alloy. Actual weight may vary due to the alloy mixture used. This mold will cast one R.E.A.L. bullet and one round ball bullet. R.E.A.L. bullets load easily even in a dirty barrel because of their unique cleaning action. They will not tumble in flight which makes them a perfect hunting bullet with heavy loads. R.E.A.L. bullets also shoot accurately even in greatly oversized barrels. Lee Precision does not recommend the use of any spray type mold release products in their bullet molds.|0.84|10.8|2.6|2.1|Lee Dual Style Bullet Mold With Handles Included|Bullet Caliber: .50 R.E.A.L. and .490 Ball|Average Bullet Weight in Grains: R.E.A.L. 320 and BALL 177; Features trochioidal venting on the mold face and sprue plate mating surface|Unique venting allows consistent and effortless fill out; All Lee Mold Blocks are made from aluminum because of the exceptional molding qualities|Mold cavities are CNC machined for unmatched roundness and size control; Most bullets from Lee molds can be used as cast without sizing|||T|WARNING: This product can expose you to chemicals including arsenic, which is known to the State of California to cause cancer.

What sets them apart is the precisely designed micro-orifice in a very specific thickness plate leading into a resonance chamber of a specific diameter. These design features limit and disrupt increasing amounts of a sound wave as the wave amplitude increases. Most ear plugs have linear attenuation, meaning, they block the same amount of sound no matter how loud your environment.

The Audiomorphic ear plug was developed under contract from DARPA (the same folks that funded the development of the internet) to allow US Army field artillerymen to be able to communicate and stay protected without wearing electronic hearing protectors. Because the level of sound blocked continuously increases as the sound increases from 70 dB to 170 dB, the amount blocked from 120 dB to 140 dB is less than a traditional earplug and things will be louder.

Because the level of sound blocked continuously increases as the sound increases from 70 dB to 170 dB, the amount blocked from 120 dB to 140 dB is less than a traditional earplug and things will be louder. As you get up to 150 dB, and more, they actually block equal or more than most standard ear plugs.|||||Advanced Noise Protection: Engineered for BOTH clear communication AND protection from gunfire; Patented design simultaneously allows range commands to pass through while providing 41 dB IPIL against loud sounds; No removeable filter to get lost|Low NRR for Clear Communication: Noise Reduction Rating of 12 dB tested at 95 dB; Effectively reduce moderate noise levels while allowing for clear conversations even in noisy settings|Innovative Non-Linear Sound Blocking: Provide an impressive Impulsive Peak Insertion Loss of 41 dB at 160 dB; Perfect for shielding ears from sudden, intense noises|Easy-Carry Earplug Solution: Ideal for a wide range of activities, from shooting ranges to concerts, these earplugs come with a removable lanyard and a carry case for easy use and portability, providing top-tier protection and clarity wherever you go|Kit includes: Ear Plugs, removeable lanyard, and carry case; Removeable lanyard is made from silicone to stretch and flex for your comfort and secure wear|||F||US|NO

The Audiomorphic earplug looks similar to many triple flange earplugs. What sets them apart is the precisely designed micro-orifice in a very specific thickness plate leading into a resonance chamber of a specific diameter. These design features limit and disrupt increasing amounts of a sound wave as the wave amplitude increases. Most ear plugs have linear attenuation, meaning, they block the same amount of sound no matter how loud your environment. This is good when it is loud but not good if you want to hear something when it is quieter. If you want to hear game when in the woods, or talk to your shooting buddy when at the range, you either have to shout or take out your ear plugs when wearing a traditional ear plug. The Audiomorphic earplug has nonlinear attenuation. They block very little sound when it is quiet and, block more sound as it gets louder. You never need to remove your earplugs to hear the quieter sounds and you stay protected as it gets louder. The Audiomorphic ear plug was developed under contract from DARPA (the same folks that funded the development of the internet) to allow US Army field artillerymen to be able to communicate and stay protected without wearing electronic hearing protectors.
